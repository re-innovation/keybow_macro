# An advanced example of how to set up a HID keyboard.

# There are three layers, selected by pressing and holding key 0 (bottom left), 
# then tapping one of the coloured layer selector keys above it to switch layer.

# The layer colours are as follows:

#  * layer 1: pink: numpad-style keys, 0-9, delete, and enter.
#  * layer 2: blue: sends strings on each key press
#  * layer 3: media controls, rev, play/pause, fwd on row one, vol. down, mute,
#             vol. up on row two

# You'll need to connect Keybow 2040 to a computer, as you would with a regular
# USB keyboard.

# Drop the keybow2040.py file into your `lib` folder on your `CIRCUITPY` drive.

# NOTE! Requires the adafruit_hid CircuitPython library also!
